This is the blog for the Chicago chapter of RailsBridge!  We're running the [HMFAYSAL OMEGA Theme](http://hmfaysal.github.io/hmfaysal-omega-theme/theme-setup/about-hmfaysal-omega/) on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

To run the site locally:

1. [Install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and read through [this installation instructions](http://hmfaysal.github.io/hmfaysal-omega-theme/theme-setup/installing-jekyll-on-windows/) if you haven't already.
2. Clone down this repo
3. Run ```jekyll serve```

Easy peasy!

Note: we still likely have some residual theme stuff in here.  Needs some clean up to get rid of the stuff we're not using.
