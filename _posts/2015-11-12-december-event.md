Are you interested in learning how to create dynamic web applications? Want to get an in-depth introduction to Ruby on Rails? RailsBridge Chicago is here to help you level up!

[Sign up on BridgeTroll](http://bridgetroll.org/events/230) to reserve your spot as either a student or volunteer!

This is a free (and fun!) introduction to Ruby on Rails for women and their guests. No programming experience is required and any level of skill is welcome, from total newbies to Rubyists who just want to brush up. We will start from scratch and walk you through the steps to set up a fully-functioning online database app by the end of the day, even if right now you couldn’t tell an app from a tea cosy! You’ll be a regular Grace Hopper in no time.

The workshop takes place over two days at Braintree in the Merchandise Mart in downtown Chicago. Friday evening you’ll meet your fellow students at installfest, where we’ll help you make sure your computer is set up with all the right tools to jump right in on Saturday morning. Saturday we’ll be coding up a storm from 10am until 5:30pm, after which we will head to an afterparty to celebrate your success!

Is Friday mandatory? Yes, yes it is. What if you've totally got everything installed, you promise? Well, think of how easy it will be on you and the lovely volunteers to get you your "all good!" sticker on Friday when they've got time to review your craftsmanship! In all seriousness, Saturday is a big day and we can't take time away from everyone's coding, so if you're not approved by Saturday morning you might not be able to participate in the workshop.

This event is open to anyone who identifies as a woman. We ask that others only sign up if they are coming as the “guest” of a female attendee (we’ll ask you who you’re coming with on the registration form). Guests must also register for the event. We need to have enough pizza to feed you all!
