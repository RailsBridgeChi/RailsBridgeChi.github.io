<p><a href="http://railsbridge.org">RailsBridge</a> started in San Francisco in 2009 as a project to increase diversity in the Ruby community. And it&#8217;s been wildly successful! The past six years have seen dozens of local chapters form, thousands of students learn to code, hundreds of volunteers donate their time, and a lot of new developer careers launch!</p>
